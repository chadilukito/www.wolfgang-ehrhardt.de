zlibw114 is my (WE) Pascal port of the zlib library V1.1.4

It is based on the V1.1.2 Pascal port PASZLIB 1.0 from Jacques Nomssi
Nzali, see readme.txt for his introduction/documentation.

It includes official patches/changes up to V1.1.4 and some results from
email communication with Marc Adler.

Further changes are in gzio/minigzip, inffixed.inc, minizip, zDeflate
(made code for $ifdef FASTEST usable), zlibh (z_assign as a workaround
for a nasty D6/7/9 bug), ZUtil, example (made test_sync code etc. work).

Other features: 1) zlibex unit with custom deflate and inflate routines
(incl. test program), it is used in the FZCA demo program.  2) Pascal
port of the zpipe sample program. 3) Code improvements: make BUILDFIXED
and assert work, bug fix in gzerror, etc.


The library can be compiled with BP7 (DOS/Win/DPMI), Delphi 1-7/9-10/12/17-18,
Virtual Pascal V2.1 and Free Pascal 1/2/3.x. (The example programs minizip 
and miniunz will not compile under D1, FPC 1.0, or BP7-Win and Delphis with 
unit_scope.)

The unit structure is slightly changed compared to paszlib:
ZLIB   (functions),
ZLIBH  (types/consts),
GZIO   (gz functions)
should be the only units USED by applications of zlib.

See manifest for archive layout.

Please note:
  * The code base V1.1.4 is very old and there are newer and better versions of
    zlib. Therefore the zlib units included in newer Delphi and FPC version
    should be used whenever possible.
  * My zlib routines should only be applied to files with sizes less that 2 GB
    (32 bit counters; Delphi eof bug and/or 32 bit filesize function).
